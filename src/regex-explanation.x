The regular expression /^(?!\/\/)(?!.*\/\*.*\*\/)\s*(using\s+(?!(\w+\s+)+\w+\s*=\s*)(\[.\w+\]|(\w+\s*=\s*)?\w+(\.\w+)*);\s*)+$/gm is used to match C# using statements that are not part of comments or string literals. Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

/^/: Matches the start of a line or string.
(?!\/\/) : Negative lookahead that ensures the pattern doesn't match lines starting with // (single-line comments).
(?!.*\/\*.*\*\/) : Negative lookahead that ensures the pattern doesn't match lines containing /*...*/ (multi-line comments).
\s* : Matches zero or more whitespace characters.
(using\s+ : Matches the literal string using followed by one or more whitespace characters.
(?!(\w+\s+)+\w+\s*=\s*) : Negative lookahead that excludes matches where the using statement is followed by an assignment (e.g., using Foo = Bar;).
(\[.\w+\]|(\w+\s*=\s*)?\w+(\.\w+)*) : Matches either:
[.\w+]: A namespace alias (e.g., [Alias]).
(\w+\s*=\s*)?: An optional static class import (e.g., static = System.Math).
\w+(\.\w+)*: A namespace or type name, optionally followed by one or more nested namespaces or types (e.g., System.Collections.Generic).
;\s* : Matches a semicolon followed by zero or more whitespace characters.
)+ : Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern (the using statement).
$/ : Matches the end of a line or string.
gm : Flags that make the regular expression global (matches all occurrences) and multi-line (treats the input string as multiple lines).
In summary, this regular expression matches one or more using statements in C# code, excluding those that are part of comments or string literals, and allowing for namespace aliases, static class imports, and nested namespaces or types. It is designed to match the entire line(s) containing the using statement(s).
